Student.java
   This is the second program.I am supposed to do 10 programs for today based
   only on the printf statements.
   All the student details are given in this program
   And also I tried make it as presentable as possible
   (feels good, getting familiar with the "tech stuff" finally)
   Coming to commands and stuff, everything is as the previous program.
