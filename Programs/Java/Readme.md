Student.java<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second program.I am supposed to do 10 programs for today based<br>
   only on the printf statements.<br>
   All the student details are given in this program<br>
   And also I tried make it as presentable as possible<br>
   (feels good, getting familiar with the "tech stuff" finally)<br>
   Coming to commands and stuff, everything is as the previous program.
