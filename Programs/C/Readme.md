This is C programs folder

HelloWorld.c
   This is my first c program...lets get rolling!!<br>
   Compiled using gcc (Gnu C Compiler)<br>
   Command: gcc HelloWorld.c<br>
   Output:a.out<br>
   Run> ./a.out <br>
   This Displays 'Hello, World!'<br>
Student.c<br>
   This is the second program.I am supposed to do 10 programs for today based<br>
   only on the printf statements.<br>
   All the student details are given in this program<br>
   And also I tried make it as presentable as possible<br>
   (feels good, getting familiar with the "tech stuff" finally)<br>
   Coming to commands and stuff, everything is as the previous program.
