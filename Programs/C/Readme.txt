This is C programs folder

HelloWorld.c
   This is my first c program...lets get rolling!!
   Compiled using gcc (Gnu C Compiler)
   Command: gcc HelloWorld.c
   Output:a.out
   Run> ./a.out 
   This Displays 'Hello, World!'
Student.c
   This is the second program.I am supposed to do 10 programs for today based
   only on the printf statements.
   All the student details are given in this program
   And also I tried make it as presentable as possible
   (feels good, getting familiar with the "tech stuff" finally)
   Coming to commands and stuff, everything is as the previous program.
